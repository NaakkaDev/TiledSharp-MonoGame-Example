# [TiledSharp](https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp) [MonoGame](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame) Example

This example shows how simple it is to draw a (TMX) map made with [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) in MonoGame project.

## Note:
Remember to add TileSharp to your projects **References**!

The (TMX) map file is **not** supposed to be build with content pipeline. Just add it to the project and set **Copy if newer** from the files properties.
